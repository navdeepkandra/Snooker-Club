        <h2>What is Snooker Actually means?</h2><br>
         <p> <big>Snooker</big> is a cue sport played on a rectangular billiards table </p>
         <p> covered with a green cloth called baize, with six pockets, one at each corner and</p>
            <p> one in the middle of each long side.</p>
        <h2>Is a Snooker Club a Profitable Business in India?</h2><br>
        <p>Well, this is a subjective question! Because the hourly charges of any snooker </p>
           <p> table vary from place to place.Usually, an hour at a snooker table in India costs about Rs. 200 to Rs. 300, irrespective of </p>
          <p>  the number of people playing. So, if you even start with 3 tables, each used for about 5 hours per day can bring you Rs. 3000 </p>
            <p>to Rs. 4500 daily. That means a revenue around Rs. 90,000 to Rs. 1 lakh each month.</p>
